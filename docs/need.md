## Address a Human Need
A common challenge students typically face in school, whether that's in elementary, high school, or university, is the inability to study or learn independently. A common obstacle is simply being motivated enough to learn to begin with. Sometimes students can find doing practice problems or memorizing countless terms/equations incredibly boring. It can also be very easy to get distracted whilst studying. A common approach that's used to circumvent these challenges is to find a group of peers to study with, or establishing some sort of reward system to maintain focus and progress. 

Our app primarily functions as a flashcard app that doubles as a co-op game intended to get users motivated in learning/studying. Users can create a collection of flashcard terms to memorize, and then play a collaborative game with their peers, where each person takes turns drawing a particular term, while everyone has to guess the term from the drawing. 
Due to the game-like nature of our app, users become much more motivated in using it as a learning platform, and because it's also collaborative, users are much more engaged in learning because their working together with their peers.
