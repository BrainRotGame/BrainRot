## Accessibility Audit

Peer Audit

Partner’s Name: Yijia Zhao
Date/Place of audit: The audit took place at an apartment, at 10:00 pm on December 4.
Devices and settings used: An iPhone with VoiceOver on.

Strengths of the app
I like the app’s idea and how smooth the interaction is. The Semantic labels are all correctly set up, including all the icons.
Weakness of the app
The UI did not handle “safe area,” causing the issue of content being covered by the notch on the iPhone. The format of the game makes it inaccessible to the blind people.

Date/Place of audit: 340 Lecture - Dec 2nd
Devices and settings used: Simulator with Screen Reader. 

Strengths
The overall consistency of the app was on point. Everything was clean and straightforward to navigate, and each element had good colors that made them pop. 
Weaknesses
Some of the buttons or text relative to the whole screen were a little small. Increasing the size of all the UI elements would go a long way in improving the app experience.
