## Accessibility Audit

Peer Audit
Name: Shangzhen Yang
Partner’s Name: Yijia Zhao
Date/Place of audit: The audit took place at an apartment, at 10:00 pm on December 4.
Devices and settings used: An iPhone with VoiceOver on.

Strengths of the app
I like the app’s idea and how smooth the interaction is. The Semantic labels are all correctly set up, including all the icons.
Weakness of the app
The UI did not handle “safe area,” causing the issue of content being covered by the notch on the iPhone. The format of the game makes it inaccessible to the blind people.
